        <h2>HTML TAG</h2>
        <BR>
        <P>
            The html tag is used to define the beginning and end of an HTML document. It is the top-level element in an HTML page and contains all other elements in the document.
            The html tag is typically the first tag in an HTML document and is followed by the head and body tags, which define the head and body sections of the document, respectively.
            The html tag can also include attributes that provide information about the document, such as the language used in the document or the character set used to encode the text.

        <h2>HEAD TAG</h2>
        <BR>
        <P>
            The head tag in HTML is used to provide information about the document, including metadata, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript code. The head element is a container for elements that provide 
            information about the document but are not displayed on the web page itself.Some of the common elements that can be included in the head tag include the title element, which 
            specifies the title of the document that appears in the browser's title bar, and the meta element, which provides metadata about the document such as keywords, descriptions, and author information.The head tag is an essential element of an HTML document, as it provides important information that is used by web browsers and search engines to understand and display the content of the page.

        <h2>TITLE TAG</h2>
        <BR>
        <P>
            The title tag in HTML is used to define the title of a web page. It is placed within the head section of an HTML document and provides a brief and descriptive title for the page. The text within the title tag is displayed in the title bar of a web browser, and is also used as the title of the
            page in search engine results and bookmarks. A well-crafted title tag can help attract visitors to a site and improve its visibility in search engine results. Each web page should have a unique and descriptive title tag that accurately reflects its content.

        <h2>BODY TAG</h2>
        <BR>
        <P>
            The body tag is an HTML element that contains all the visible content displayed in a web page. It is typically placed 
            within the body tag and can include various HTML elements such as text, images, links, headings, lists, tables, forms, 
            and multimedia. The body tag is used to structure the content of a web page and provide a logical hierarchy of information. 
            It is an essential element of every web page and is used to create the main content area of a site.

        <h2>HEADING TAG</h2>
        <BR>
        <P>
            The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 tags are HTML tags used to define headings on a web page. The h1 tag is typically used for the main heading of a page, while the other tags are used for subheadings and lower-level headings.

            These tags are used to provide structure and hierarchy to the content of a web page, and help to break up long blocks of text into smaller, more easily digestible sections. Headings also play an important role in search engine optimization (SEO), as they provide information about the content and organization of a page to search engines.
                
            The h1 tag is usually used only once per page, as it represents the main heading of the page. Subsequent headings are typically nested within each other, with h2 tags used for the main subheading, h3 tags for sub-subheadings, and so on. Proper use of heading tags can help to improve the accessibility, usability, and readability of a web page.

        <h2>P TAG</h2>
        <BR>
        <P>
            The p tag in HTML is used to define a paragraph of text. It is a block-level element that creates a new line before and after the paragraph. The text within the p tag is displayed with a default margin and line spacing, but this can be customized using CSS.

            The p tag is commonly used to structure text content on a web page and to group related sentences or paragraphs together. It is a simple and effective way to create clear and well-organized content. The p tag can also be used in combination with other HTML elements, such as headings, lists, and links, to create more complex content structures.
