                    Coding, also referred to as computer programming, is the way that software developers tell a computer what they 
                    would like it to do.When writing code, developers give a set of instructions to a computer, and those instructions
                    are called “code.” This means that coding is just the art of writing lines of code.

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to create content for the World Wide Web. It consists of a series of tags and attributes 
            that are used to define the structure and layout of web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML is used to create text-based documents that can be displayed in a web browser. It is responsible for specifying the content of a web page, 
            including text, images, videos, and other multimedia elements. HTML tags are used to indicate the beginning and end of each element on a web page, 
            and each tag can have one or more attributes that provide additional information about the element.
        </p>
        <p>   
            Some of the most common HTML tags include headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, forms, and lists. These tags can be used to structure 
            the content of a web page and to provide additional functionality, such as enabling users to submit forms or navigate to other pages.
        </p>
        <p>   
            HTML is a foundational technology for the web and is used in conjunction with other technologies such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and 
            JavaScript to create modern, interactive websites.
